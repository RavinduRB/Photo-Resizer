I created a photo resizer application using only Python programming language ðŸš€. A problem that came to me while doing some projects at the university was that the size of the photos taken for the projects was small. Even after using several online tools, I could not get any significant results. So I decided to create an application like this. Another problem encountered while using this application is the quality of the image obtained by resizing. I hope to include the photo enhancing part in the next update of this application.

The Pillow Library must be installed before running the code.
 âœ¨ pip install pillow
